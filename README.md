# PeertoPeer-VS-Client-Server

a mixture of protocols P2P and Client-Server that will serve as a communication protocol between an external client of the Raspberry pi implemented in python and a server in java. The protocol is complete, so it can be fully tested and approved.
Note: for the test the client is in java, but soon it will be made available a client in python

we do not need any particular parameter. just clone the project and 

compile in the console like
 
javac Chat.java then run.
